So, you want to convert audio to text using Python and you think it should be as simple as just running a script? Well, you're in luck because this project does just that. It starts recording when you tell it to and stops when you say "stop". Groundbreaking, right?

## ✨ Features
- 🎙️ Record audio until you say "stop". Because pressing a button is too mainstream.
- 📝 Convert recorded audio to text. Yes, it does what it says on the tin.
- 🧵 Multithreading support, because who doesn't love a good thread?

## 🛠️ Requirements
- 🐍 Python 3.11 If you're still on Python 2, it's time to upgrade.
- 📚 `speech_recognition` library. Because we all need more libraries in our lives.

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone this absolutely amazing repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Saitej6/AudioToTextConverter/tree/main
    cd speech-to-text
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment. It's not mandatory, but you'll thank me later:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies. Because dependencies make the world go round:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Run the script, because how else will you convert audio to text?

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. The script will start recording your precious voice. Say "stop" when you've had enough.

## 🗂️ File Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that does all the heavy lifting.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python libraries, because of course you need them.

## 🎉 Example

Run the script, let it record your voice until you say "stop". Then, magically, it will transcribe your voice into text. It's like having your own personal stenographer.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

- A big thank you to the `speech_recognition` library. We couldn't have done it without you. Seriously, we couldn't.
